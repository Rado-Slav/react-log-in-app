# Getting Started

To get a local copy of the project up and running, follow these simple steps:

# Prerequisites

Make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) installed on your machine. You can check this by running:

```bash
node -v
npm -v
```

# Project Set Up

Clone the Repository
First, clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Rado-Slav/react-log-in-app
cd react-log-in-app
```

Install Dependencies
Install the project dependencies using npm:

```bash
npm install
```

Running the App
To start the app in development mode:

```bash
npm start
```

Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser to view the app. The page will reload if you make edits. You will also see any lint errors in the console.

Running Tests
To run tests:

```bash
npm test
```

This will launch the test runner in interactive watch mode. For more details on running tests, see the Create React App testing documentation.

Building for Production
To build the app for production:

```bash
npm run build
```

This will create a build folder with a minified and optimized production build.

Ejecting
Note: This is a one-way operation. Once you eject, you can’t go back!

If you need more control over the build configuration, you can eject:

```bash
npm run eject
```

This command will remove the single build dependency from your project and copy all the configuration files and dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc.) into your project.
